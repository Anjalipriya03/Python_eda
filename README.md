## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parallel-data-processing.git
    cd parallel-data-processing
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
